                                                                         TRACKER LIST

Complete: Sep 12	Stress-test for loops	Play around with the decimal points of for loop to see when they break down 	
Complete: Sep 26	Pointers and Arrays	Play around with pointers, malloc, realloc and free while building arrays (normal and dynamic)
Complete: Sep 26	Implement Linked List	"Given a set of values (assume int), create a linked list from them"	
Complete: Sep 29	Half a Linked List	Develop an algorithm that prints the first half of a given linked list without knowing how many elements in the array? 	Hare-tortoise pointers (?)
Complete: Sep 29	Reverse a Linked List	"Given head pointer of a linked list, reverse the list."	
Complete: Sep 29	Chunk Reverse a Linked List	"Given head pointer of a linked list, and an integer k (1<=k<=n), reverse every k elements of the list"	If size of last chunk <k, reverse it regardless
Complete: Oct 20	Binary Tree	"Given an array (assume int), construct a Binary Search Tree from it."	You can use either arrrays or linked lists in construction
Complete: Oct 20	Binary Tree Delete Operation	Professor has covered the insert and build operations, how do you go about deleting nodes?	

MIDTERM BREAK			
Complete: Oct 31	Selection Sort I	"Given an array (assume int), sort the array using Selection Sort"	
Complete: Oct 31	Insertion Sort I	Same as above using Insertion Sort	
Complete: Oct 31	Selection Sort II	"Given head pointer of a linked list, sort the list using Selection Sort"	
Complete: Oct 31	Insertion Sort II	Same as above using Insertion Sort	
Complete: Oct 31	Quick Sort II	Perform Quicksort on an array and a linked list	
Complete: Nov 3	Heaps and Heapsort!	Given an array, build a heap and sort it!	We sorted heaps using selection sort - we call the entire process Heapsort (read Lec 10 Notes)
Complete: Nov 7	AVL Trees	Given an array, construct an AVL tree with helper operations (including left and right rotations) Every time you delete or insert a node, you need to check how 'balanced' the tree is and if it is not balanced, you need to left or right rotate parts of the tree. 
Complete: Nov 21	Skip Lists	Basic Skip List with 2 pointers
